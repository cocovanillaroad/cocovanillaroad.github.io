## Hello Fellow Homo Sapiens!

I am a Graphic Designer and an aspiring Watercolor Artist. I am currently on leave busy raising a human being. This website will be revamped soon so watch out!

In the mean time, check me out on my social media accounts as I post interesting stuff.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/cocovanillaroad/cocovanillaroad.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/cocovanillaroad/cocovanillaroad.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
